# rogue

Game with generated dungeons and accessible API. 

The original purpose of it is to serve as an exercise for building a dungeon and a player AI that can complete it. Dungeon generation is based on [munificent](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/12/21/rooms-and-mazes/) method and [brad811](https://github.com/brad811/go-dungeon) implementation. Can be played in cmd or with http requests.
